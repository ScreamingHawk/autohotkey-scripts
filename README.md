# AutoHotkey Scripts

Repo for all my auto hotkey scripts

## Always on top

`always-on-top.ahk` makes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> set the current window to *always on top* mode.

## Restart slack

`restart-slack.ahk` makes <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> kill Slack, then start it again.

Fucken Slack...

## Notes

All scripts will create a shortcut in your start up folder so that they are enabled at start up.
